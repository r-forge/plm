	behave correctly

	* for two-ways within models with instrumental variables, K is

	* the pvcovHC function is replaced by suitable vcovHC methods for

Changes since version 1-1.1

	* part of the "details" section of the fixef.plm man page is
	removed

	* a fitted.value method is now available for plm objects. It
	returns the fitted values of the untransformed response

	of a bug while estimating a model like plm(inv~value-1, data =
	Grunfeld, model = "fd")

	* the lev2var is changed so that it doesn't result in an error
	when the data.frame contains no factor: this was responsible for a

	been added

Change since version 1-1.4

	* a args argument is added for plm objects, and the internal
	function relies now on it (and not on the call as previously)

	* more attention is paid when one of the estimated components of
	the variance is negative (warning or error messages result)

	* pdata.frame objects are re-introduced. They are used to compute

	* the first argument of pgmm may now be a formula. A lag.form must
	be provided in this case

	* the pvalue for purtest(..., type = "madwu") was in error (by a
	factor of 2)

	* in formula(dynformula), a bug is fixed so that the endog
	variable doesn't appear on the rhs if there is no lags

	* in pgmm, the extract.data has been rewriten and is *much* faster

	* two new functions vcovBK and vcovSCC have been added

	* a 'model' argument is added to pgmm.sys and pgmm.diff

	oldpgmm

	* lag.pseries is now able to deal with vector arguments for lags,
	e.g. lag(x, c(1,3))
	
	* suml(x) is replaced by Reduce("+", x)


Changes since version 1.2-4

	* bug corrected in pgmm : ud <- cbind(ud, td.gmm.level) is
	relevant only for twoways models

	* in fitted.plm, the extraction of the index is updated

	* the residuals.plm method now has a model argument

	arguments anymore (like in model.matrix.plm)

	Terry Therneau after his reorganization of the packages).

	* fixed DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE accordingly.

	* fixed the example in pggls.Rd


	
Changes since version 1.2-6

	* a bug in mtest for pgmm models with effect=individual and
	transformation=ld *and* for the wald test for time.dummies for
	model with effect = twoways and transformation=ld is fixed by
	modifying namest in gmm
	
	* there was a bug in pgmm for models with different lags for gmm
	instruments. The number of time-series lost is now the min (and
	not the max) of the first lags for gmm instruments

	* some parts of summmary.pgmm only worked correctly for model with
	time-dummies. It now deals correctly for model with 'individual'
	effects

	* the rda files are now compressed

	* p-values for the two-tailed versions of plmtest() were wrong and
	have been fixed. They were divided by 2 instead of multiplied.

	* the pgmm method has been rewriten ; the data frame is then first
	balanced and NAs are then overwriten by 0s

Changes since version 1.2-9	

	* the pccep function, estimating CCEP models a la Pesaran, has
	been added together withsummary and print.summary methods. The
	function generates objects of a class of their own ("pccep"), much
	like 'pggls', together with 'panelmodel'.

	* the pmg function, estimating MG, DMG and CCEMG models a la
	Pesaran, has been added together with summary and print.summary
	methods. The function generates objects of a class of their own
	("pmg"), much like 'pggls', together with 'panelmodel'. In the
	future must consider possible merger with 'pvcm'.

        * the new cipstest function performs a second-generation CIPS test
	for unit roots on pseries objects

        * the new (hidden) function pmerge is used internally by cipstest
	to merge lags and differences of a pseries into the original
	pdata.frame. Will possibly be added to the user space in the
	future.

Changes since version 1.2-10

	coefficients, so that it can easily be extracted using the coef
	method

	method

	* a new argument lost.ts is added in pgmm to select manually the

	series

	* plm now accept three part formulas, the last part being for
	instruments introduced only in the within form

	* the predict method for panelmodel objects is now exported

	provided as the first argument

	so that a subset of coefficient may be selected

	* fixed a small problem on the printing of the typologie of the
	variables for pht models
	
	* the "name" of the tests is now the formula truncated so that it
	prints on only one line
	
	* restrict.matrix argument added to deals with linear restrictions

	* a vcov argument is added to summary.plm so that a variance matrix can be supplied

	* the deviance method for panelmodel objects is now exported (12/02)

Changes since version 1.5-1

	* fixed "already a pdata.frame" bug in pcdtest.formula

	* pbgtest: fixed/enabled type="F" (F test of lmtest::bgtest) in wrapper pbgtest() and
	  fixed/enabled passing of argument order.by= [additional argument in
	  lmtest::bgtest] [tests/testpbgtest.R added, docs updated and extended]
	
	* phtest( , method="aux") [Hausman regression-based test]: fixed bug when data= contains more cases than
	  there are used in model estimation (due to NA values); avoid calc. of RE model a second time;
	  phtest now also works with between model correctly (fixed degrees of freedom)
	  tests/test_phtest_Hausman_regression.R added
	  
	* plm(): original row names of inputted data are preserved in plm_object$model,
	  so functions like pmodel.response(), model.frame(), model.matrix(), residuals()
	  return the original row.names (and thus fancy rownames if those were to be computed by pdata.frame);
	  as.data.frame.pdata.frame(): respects row.names argument
