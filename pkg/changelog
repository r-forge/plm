Changes since version 0-1.2

	* Models with only one explanatory variable resulted in a
	bug. This has been fixed.

	* Estimation methods are now available with four functions : plm,
	pvcm, pggls and pgmm instead of one (plm) in the previous version.

	models. The "nopool" model is now part of it.

	FGLS.

	* for all estimation functions, the first four arguments are now
	formula,data,effect,model

	function

	removed by pdata.frame

	* the names of some arguments have changed (random.methods ->
	ercomp, inst.method -> ivar), the old names are accepted with a
	warning,

	* the instuments argument is removed, instrumental variable
	estimation is performed using extended formula. The instruments
	argument is still accepted with a warning,

	* the model argument of plm objects are now ordinary data.frame,
	and not data.frame with elements y and X. Moreover, this
	data.frame contains untransformed data

	* the data sets which are relevant for panel data estimation that
	where previously in the Ecdat package are now in the plm package

	* in pvcm a bug when the estimation was made on a subset is fixed

	* ercomp is a stand alone function which returns the estimation of
	the components of the variance of the errors,
	
	* the estimation of two-ways within model is now implemented for
	unbalanced panels,

	* the fixef method is much improved, the fixed effects may be
	computed in levels, in deviation from the first level or in
	deviation from the overall mean

	* in pbsytest, the arguments test are now in lowercases,

	* the pvcovHC function is replaced by suitable vcovHC methods for
	panelmodel and pgmm models
	
Changes since version 1-1.0

	* in fixef, the effect argument default is now NULL:
	fixef(model_with_time_effect) now works correctly

	* in pFtest, the error message "the arguments should be a within
	and a pooling model" is removed so that two within models may be
	provided

	* for backward compatibility reasons, the pvcovHC is reintroduced.

	* for backward compatibility reasons, argument test of pbsytest
	may be indicated in upper case

	* we switched back to old names for two arguments of plm ercomp ->
	random.methods ivar -> inst.method -> ivar

	* amemiya method is not implemented for unbalanced panels: an error
	message is now returned.
 

Changes since version 1-1.1

	* part of the "details" section of the fixef.plm man page is
	removed

	* a fitted.value method is now available for plm objects. It
	returns the fitted values of the untransformed response
	
	* in pdiff, a drop=FALSE is added. This omission was responsible
	of a bug while estimating a model like plm(inv~value-1, data =
	Grunfeld, model = "fd")

	* the lev2var is changed so that it doesn't result in an error
	when the data.frame contains no factor: this was responsible for a

	been added

Change since version 1-1.4

	* a args argument is added for plm objects, and the internal
	function relies now on it (and not on the call as previously)

	* more attention is paid when one of the estimated components of
	the variance is negative (warning or error messages result)

	* pdata.frame objects are re-introduced. They are used to compute
	model.frames. Extraction from pdata.frames results in 'pserie'
	objects which have an index attribute.

	* the print method of ercomp is now exported

	* the first argument of pgmm may now be a formula. A lag.form must
	be provided in this case
	
	* hausman-taylor estimation is now performed by the pht function. For
	backaward compatibility reasons, it is still possible to estimate
	this model with plm

Changes since version 1.2-0	

	* the as.matrix and print methods for pserie objects are now exported

	* in summary.plm, the p-value is now computed using a Student
	distribution and not a normal one

	* the lag.pserie method is modified so that it deals correctly

	method returns an error if its argument is not numeric

	* the instruments-"backward compatibility" stuff in plm is
	simplified thanks to the new features of Formula

	* 'pserie' is renamed 'pseries'

	* a THANKS file is added

	backward compatibility feature is added for the "index" attribute

Changes since version 1.2-1

	* a new purtest function to perform unit root tests

	* [[.pdata.frame is modified so that NULL (and not an error
	message) is returned if an unknown column is selected

	* the documentation has been improved
	
	* the pvalue for purtest(..., type = "madwu") was in error (by a factor of 2)

	* in formula(dynformula), a bug is fixed so that the endog
	variable doesn't appear on the rhs if there is no lags

	* in pgmm, the extract.data has been rewriten and is *much* faster

	* two new functions vcovBK and vcovSCC have been added

	* a 'model' argument is added to pgmm.sys and
	pgmm.diff (previously, the model name was extracted from the call)

Changes since version 1.2-3
	
	* lag.pseries now returns relevant names for the returned factor
	
	* pFormula is modified so that it can handle correctly Formula
	object, and not only formula
	
	* pgmm has been completely rewriten with a new 'Formula'
	interface. Old formula and dynformula interfaces are kept for
	backward compatibility but won't be maintained in the future

	oldpgmm

	* lag.pseries is now able to deal with vector arguments for lags,
