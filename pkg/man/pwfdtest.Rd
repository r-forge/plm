\description{ First-differencing-based test of serial correlation for
  (the idiosyncratic component of) the errors in either levels or
  first-differenced panel models.  }

\usage{
pwfdtest(x,...)
\method{pwfdtest}{panelmodel}(x, ..., h0 = c("fd","fe"))
\method{pwfdtest}{formula}(x, data, ..., h0 = c("fd","fe"))
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{an object of class \code{formula},}
  \item{data}{a \code{data.frame},}
  \item{h0}{the null hypothesis: one of "fd","fe"}
  \item{...}{further arguments to be passed on to
  \code{linear.hypothesis} or to \code{vcovHC}}

\details{

  As Wooldridge (2003, 10.6.3) observes, if the idiosyncratic errors in
  the model in levels are uncorrelated (which we label hypothesis
  \code{"fe"}), then the errors of the model in first differences (FD)
  must be serially correlated with \eqn{cor(\hat{e}_{it}, \hat{e}_{is})=-0.5}
  for each \eqn{t,s}.  If on the contrary the levels
  model's errors are a random walk, then there must be no serial
  correlation in the FD errors (hypothesis \code{"fd"}). Both the fixed
  effects (FE) and the first differenced (FD) estimators remain
  consistent under either assumption, but relative efficiency changes:
  FE is more efficient under \code{"fe"}, FD under \code{"fd"}.

Wooldridge (ibid.) suggests basing a test for either hypothesis on a
pooled regression of FD residuals on their first lag:
\eqn{\hat{e}_{i,t}=\alpha + \delta \hat{e}_{i,t-1} + \eta_{i,t}}. Rejecting
the restriction \eqn{\delta = -0.5} makes us conclude against the null of no
serial correlation in errors of the levels equation (\code{"fe"}). The
null hypothesis of no serial correlation in differenced errors
(\code{"fd"}) is tested in a similar way, but based on the
zero-restriction on \eqn{\delta}. Rejecting \code{"fe"} favours the use of
the first-difference estimator and the contrary, although it is possible
that both be rejected.

\code{pwartest} estimates the \code{fd} model and retrieves residuals,
then estimates an AR(1) \code{pooling} model on them. The test statistic
is obtained by applying \code{linear.hypothesis()} to the latter model
to test the relevant restriction on \eqn{\delta}, setting the covariance
matrix to \code{vcovHC} with the option \code{method=''arellano''} to
control for serial correlation.

Unlike the \code{pbgtest} and \code{pdwtest}, this test does not rely on
T-asymptotics and has therefore good properties in ''short''
panels. Furthermore, it is robust to general heteroskedasticity. The
\code{"fe"} version can be used to test for error autocorrelation
regardless of whether the maintained specification has fixed or random
effects (see Drukker, 2003).
