\title{A function to extract the model.response}

\description{
pmodel.response has several methods to conveniently extract the
response of several objects.
}

\usage{
pmodel.response(object, \dots)
\method{pmodel.response}{data.frame}(object,
                                     model = c("pooling","within","Between",
                                               "between","mean","random","fd"),
                                     effect = c("individual","time","twoways"),
                                     lhs = NULL,
                                     theta = NULL, \dots)
\method{pmodel.response}{pFormula}(object, data,
                                   model = c("pooling","within","Between",
                                             "between","mean","random","fd"),
                                   effect = c("individual","time","twoways"),
                                   lhs = NULL,
                                   theta = NULL, \dots)
\method{pmodel.response}{plm}(object, \dots)
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{an object of class \code{"plm"}, or a formula of class \code{"pFormula"},}
  \item{data}{a \code{pdata.frame}, which is a model frame (if not, it is tried to construct
  the model frame from the data, see \bold{Details}),}
  \item{effect}{the effects introduced in the model, one of
  \code{"individual"}, \code{"time"} or \code{"twoways"},}
  \item{model}{one of \code{"pooling"}, \code{"within"},
    \code{"between"}, \code{"random",} \code{"fd"} and \code{"ht"},}
  \item{theta}{the parameter for the transformation if \code{model = "random"},}
  \item{lhs}{inherited from package \code{\link[Formula]{Formula}} (see there),}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments.}
}

\value{
A numeric vector.
}

\details{
The model response is extracted from a \code{pdata.frame} (where the response
must reside in the first column; this is the case for a model frame), a \code{pFormula} + \code{data} or a
\code{plm} object, and the transformation specified by \code{effect} and \code{model} is
applied to it.\cr
Constructing the model frame first ensures proper NA handling and the response being
placed in the first column, see also \bold{Examples} for usage.

\examples{
# First, make a pdata.frame
data(Grunfeld)
pGrunfeld <- pdata.frame(Grunfeld)

# then make a model frame from a pFormula and a pdata.frame
pform <- pFormula(inv ~ value + capital)
mf <- model.frame(pform, data = pGrunfeld)

# construct (transformed) response of the within model
resp <- pmodel.response(pform, data = mf, model = "within")

# retrieve (transformed) response directly from model frame
resp_mf <- pmodel.response(mf, model = "within")

# retrieve (transformed) response from a plm object, i.e. an estimated model
fe_model <- plm(pform, data = pGrunfeld, model = "within")
pmodel.response(fe_model)

# same as constructed before
all.equal(resp, pmodel.response(fe_model), check.attributes = FALSE) # TRUE
