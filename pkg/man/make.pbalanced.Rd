\title{Make data balanced}

\description{This function makes the data balanced, i.e. each individual has the same time periods}

\usage{
\method{make.pbalanced}{pdata.frame}(x, balance.type = c("fill", "shared"), \dots)
\method{make.pbalanced}{pseries}(x, balance.type = c("fill", "shared"), \dots)
\method{make.pbalanced}{data.frame}(x, balance.type = c("fill", "shared"), index = NULL, \dots)
}

\arguments{
 \item{x}{an object of class \code{pdata.frame}, \code{data.frame}, or \code{pseries};}
 \item{balance.type}{character, one of \code{"fill"}, \code{"shared"}, see Detail, }
 \item{index}{only relevant for \code{data.frame} interface; if \code{NULL}, the first two columns of the data.frame are 
              assumed to be the index variables; if not \code{NULL}, both dimensions ('individual', 'time') need to be 
              specified by \code{index} as character of length 2 for data frames, for further details see \code{\link{pdata.frame}},}
 \item{\dots}{further arguments.}
}

\value{
An object of the same class as the input \code{x}, i.e. a pdata.frame, data.frame or a pseries which is made balanced 
based on the index variables. The returned data are sorted as a stacked time series.
}

\details{
 (p)data.frame and pseries objects are made balanced, meaning each individual has the same time periods.
 Depending on the value of \code{balance.type}, the balancing is done in two different ways:
 \itemize{
  \item \code{balance.type = "fill"} (default):
         The union of  available time periods over all individuals is taken (w/o \code{NA} values).
         Missing time periods for an individual are identified and corresponding rows (elements for pseries) are 
         inserted and filled with \code{NA} for the non--index variables (elements for a pseries).
         This means, only time periods present for at least one individual are inserted, if missing.
 
  \item \code{balance.type = "shared"}:
         The intersect of available time periods over all individuals is taken (w/o \code{NA} values). 
         Thus, time periods not available for all individuals are discarded (only time periods shared among
         all individuals are left in the result).
 }
  The data are not necessarily made consecutive (regularly time series with distance 1), because balancedness does not imply
 consecutiveness. For making the data consecutive, use \code{\link{make.pconsecutive}} (and, optionally, set argument 
 \code{balanced = TRUE} to make consecutive and balanced, see also \bold{Examples} for a comparison of the two functions.
 
 Note: rows of (p)data.frames (elements for pseries) with \code{NA} values in individual or time index are not examined but
 silently dropped before the data are made balanced. In this case, it cannot be inferred which individual or time period is 
 meant by the missing value(s) (see also \bold{Examples}). Especially, this means: \code{NA} values in the first/last position 
 of the original time periods for an individual are dropped, which are usually meant to depict the beginning and ending of 
 the time series for that individual. Thus, one might want to check if there are any \code{NA} values in the index variables 
 before applying make.pbalanced, and especially check for \code{NA} values in the first and last position for each individual 
 in original data and, if so, maybe set those to some meaningful begin/end value for the time series.
