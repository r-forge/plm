\details{
\code{plm} is a general function for the estimation of linear panel
models. It supports the following estimation methods: pooled OLS
(\code{model = "pooling"}), fixed effects (\code{"within"}), random
effects (\code{"random"}), first--differences (\code{"fd"}), and between
(\code{"between"}). It supports unbalanced panels and two--way effects
(although not with all methods).

For random effects models, four estimators of the transformation
parameter are available by setting \code{random.method} to one of \code{"swar"} (Swamy and Arora (1972)) (default),
\code{"amemiya"} (Amemiya (1971)), \code{"walhus"} (Wallace and Hussain (1969)), or \code{"nerlove"} (Nerlove (1971)).

For first--difference models, the intercept is maintained (which from a specification viewpoint amounts to allowing for a trend in the levels model). The user can exclude it from the estimated specification the usual way by adding \code{"-1"} to the model formula.

Instrumental variables estimation is obtained using two--part formulas,
the second part indicating the instrumental variables used. This can be
a complete list of instrumental variables or an update of the first
part. If, for example, the model is \code{y ~ x1 + x2 + x3}, with
\code{x1} and \code{x2} endogenous and \code{z1} and \code{z2} external
instruments, the model can be estimated with:

\itemize{
  \item \code{formula=y~x1+x2+x3 | x3+z1+z2},
  \item \code{formula=y~x1+x2+x3 | .-x1-x2+z1+z2}.
}

Balestra and Varadharajan-Krishnakumar's or Baltagi's method is used if
\code{inst.method="bvk"} or if \code{inst.method="baltagi"}, respectively.
  
The Hausman--Taylor estimator is computed if \code{model = "ht"}.
}

\value{
An object of class \code{c("plm","panelmodel")}.

A \code{"plm"} object has the following elements :
  
\item{coefficients}{the vector of coefficients,}
\item{vcov}{the variance--covariance matrix of the coefficients,}
\item{residuals}{the vector of residuals,}
\item{df.residual}{degrees of freedom of the residuals,}
\item{formula}{an object of class \code{'pFormula'} describing the
  model,}
\item{model}{the model frame as a \code{'pdata.frame'} containing the
  variables used for estimation: the response is in first column followed
  by the other variables, the individual and time indexes are in the 'index'
  attribute of \code{model},}
\item{ercomp}{an object of class \code{'ercomp'} providing the
 estimation of the components of the errors (for random effects models only),}
\item{aliased}{named logical vector indicating any aliased coefficients which 
are silently dropped by \code{plm} due to linearly dependent terms (see also 
\code{\link[plm]{detect_lin_dep}}),}
\item{call}{the call.}

% some elements not listed here...: "assign", "contrast", etc...

% \item{na.action}{if relevant, information about handling of NAs by the 
% model.frame function,}
% NB: na.action is currently not included as it is not supported

It has \code{print}, \code{summary} and \code{print.summary} methods.
The \code{summary} method creates an object of class \code{"summary.plm"} that 
extends the object it is run on with information about (inter alia) F statistic 
and (adjusted) R-squared of model, standard errors, t--values, and p--values of 
coefficients, (if supplied) the furnished vcov, see \code{\link[plm]{summary.plm}}
for further details.
}

\seealso{
\code{\link[plm]{summary.plm}} for further details about the associated summary method and the
"summary.plm" object both of which provide some model tests and tests of coefficients. 
\code{\link[plm]{fixef}} to compute the fixed effects for "within" models (=fixed effects models).
