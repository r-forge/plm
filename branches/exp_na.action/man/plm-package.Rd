  plm package: linear models for panel data
}
\description{
plm is a package for R which intends to make the estimation of linear panel models straightforward.
plm provides functions to estimate a wide variety of models and to make (robust) inference.}

\details{
  For a gentle and comprehensive introduction to the package, please see the package's vignette.
  
  The main functions to estimate models are:
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{plm} \tab panel data estimators using \code{lm} on transformed data,
  }
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{pgmm} \tab generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation for panel data,
  }
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{pvcm} \tab variable coefficients models for panel data,
  }
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{pmg} \tab mean groups (MG), demeaned MG and common correlated effects (CCEMG) estimators.
  }

  Next to the model estimation functions, the package offers several functions for statistical tests related to panel data/models.
  
  Multiple functions for (robust) variance--covariance matrices are at hand as well.

  The package also provides data sets to demonstrate functions and to replicate some text book/paper results.
  Use \code{data(package="plm")} to view a list of available data sets in the package.
